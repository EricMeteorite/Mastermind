There are 2 roles, 1 is Code Maker, 2 is Code Breaker.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
+ First, let Code Maker set a password. In the game, there is 
a row of holes at one end of the board, and the code breaker 
is invisible. Code Maker requires to set a total of 4 elements 
within 8 elements for password, and then put them in that 
row of holes in any order. For Code Breaker to guess.

+ Then, Code Breaker now needs to try to find the passwords 
by selecting 4 numbers at a time and arrange them in the 
order they think they match the passwords.

+ After each guess of Code Breaker, Code Maker will provide 
corresponding clues: If the guess is the correct position and 
the correct number, it will display number after 'B' (Black), 
and only the correct number will display number after 'Wâ€™
(White), But the position is wrong and the number is not 
correct, it will not be displayed.

+ Code Breaker have to guess the code password in 10 times, 
otherwise they will lose in this round of the game. Conversely, 
when all the numbers in the password are guessed and they 
are in the correct position, Code Breaker will win the game.

+ If Code Breaker WINS, the score for each round is "the 
number of remaining 10 chances" * 100 + 200 points, and the 
Code Maker score is "the number of players used" * 100 points.

+ If Code Breaker LOSES, Code Maker gets 10 * 100 + 200 points, 
and Code Breaker does not score.

+ Note: When Code Breaker uses Hint, each Hint will immediately 
subtract 200 points.

+ When one of the players reaches 5000 Score, the game 
is won.
